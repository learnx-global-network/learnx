# LearnX global network site prototype
* All html files in same folder
* All js, css, images in their respective folders
* No dependencies, so no external library that need more HTTP requests and several hundread KB download
* Less template => more unique ;-)
* Podcasts HTML card constructor based on JSON file, in anticipation of server communications
## Doubts / desires
* Side navigation bar: ring on wide screen, openable via a button on mobile devices. Is it too far off the recognizable design?
* It would be cool to put the SVG of the logo as water mark;
* Not completely sure of header title design on mobile devices.
* Is the team page necessary? Couldn't it be at the end of the about page?
## Feedback
For now, there are only the landing page (`index.html`) and the interviews or podcasts page (`interviews.html`), but if you like this design we'll expand it to all other pages. So, tell me what you think about it.
